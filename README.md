# Artificial City Simulation
## System modelling and simulation course, AGH UST 2019/2020
University team project - simulation of urban traffic in a district of Warsaw.

Simulation based on Nagel-Schreckenberg Model.

Real traffic flow data analysed to create realistic simulation.

Scale of simulation is different from real so as to make it easier to demonstrate.
